student database to track student and school information.

1.) A link to the video tutorial.

1.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yqu8YF29cU

2.) Description of the main learning objectives for this project

2.) Practicing creating a database to be able to add student and school information and store it on a database that is being hosted by a live webserver such as Heroku. To understand how to create functioning databases in order to complete our Computer System Studio III requirement.

3.) Description of challenges that you ran into and the process of how you worked through the issues.

3.) I struggled in the beginning when I tried using Turbo 360 as my staging environment, found out later that their ended up being a software issue on the computer lab computers, which prevented everyone from being able to use it. Ended up using Express as my environment to complete the build of my student/school database. Using handlebar was much more friendlier than using pug from the last project database I worked on.

4.) Reflection on how you see this tutorial helping you approach future web projects.

4.) I feel like I learned quite a bit through all of my trial and errors. I ran into a few problems in the beginning when first deploying my database to Heroku, but know I feel like I have a much better handle on things in general.I look forward to learning how to work with SQL in the near future.
